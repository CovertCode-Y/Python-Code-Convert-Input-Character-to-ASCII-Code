# Python-Code-Convert-Input-Character-to-ASCII-Code

In this code:

The get_ascii_code function takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII code using the ord() function. ord() returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character.

The user is prompted to enter a character using the input() function, and the entered character is stored in the variable input_character.

The get_ascii_code function is called with input_character as its argument to obtain the ASCII code of the entered character.
